type Role struct {
	// The trust relationship policy document that grants an entity permission to assume the role.In IAM,
	// you must provide a JSON policy that has been converted to a string. However, for AWS CloudFormation
	// templates formatted in YAML, you can provide the policy in JSON or YAML format. AWS CloudFormation
	// always converts a YAML policy to JSON format before submitting it to IAM.The regex pattern used to
	// validate this parameter is a string of characters consisting of the following:  Any printable ASCII
	// character ranging from the space character (\u0020) through the end of the ASCII character range
	//   The printable characters in the Basic Latin and Latin-1 Supplement character set (through \u00FF)
	//   The special characters tab (\u0009), line feed (\u000A), and carriage return (\u000D)
	//
	//  Upon success, the response includes the same trust policy in JSON format.
	AssumeRolePolicy string `cloudformation:"AssumeRolePolicyDocument" input:"assume_role_policy" json:"AssumeRolePolicyDocument"`

	// A description of the role.
	Description *string `cloudformation:"Description" input:"description"`

	// The maximum session duration (in seconds) that you want to set for the
	// specified role. If you do not specify a value for this setting, the
	// default maximum of one hour is applied. This setting can have a value
	// from 1 hour to 12 hours.Anyone who assumes the role from the AWS CLI or
	// API can use the DurationSeconds API parameter or the duration-seconds
	// CLI parameter to request a longer session. The MaxSessionDuration
	// setting determines the maximum duration that can be requested using the
	// DurationSeconds parameter. If users don't specify a value for the
	// DurationSeconds parameter, their security credentials are valid for one
	// hour by default. This applies when you use the AssumeRole* API
	// operations or the assume-role* CLI operations but does not apply when
	// you use those operations to create a console URL. For more information,
	// see Using IAM Roles:
	// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use.html in
	// the IAM User Guide.

	// https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/Using_Identifiers.html
	// in the IAM User Guide.This parameter is optional. If it is not included,
	// it defaults to a slash (/).This parameter allows (through its regex
	// pattern) a string of characters consisting of either a forward slash (/)
	// by itself or a string that must begin and end with forward slashes. In
	// addition, it can contain any ASCII character from the ! (\u0021) through
	// the DEL character (\u007F), including most punctuation characters,
	// digits, and upper and lowercased letters.
	Path *string `cloudformation:"Path" input:"path"`

	// The ARN of the policy that is used to set the permissions boundary for
	// the role.
	PermissionsBoundary *string `cloudformation:"PermissionsBoundary" input:"permissions_boundary"`

	// User Guide.If any one of the tags is invalid or if you exceed the
	// allowed number of tags per role, then the entire request fails and the
	// role is not created.
	Tags []struct {
		// The key name that can be used to look up or retrieve the associated
		// value. For example, Department or Cost Center are common choices.
		Key string `input:"key"`

		// The value associated with this tag. For example, tags with a key name of
		// Department could have values such as Human Resources, Accounting, and
		// Support. Tags with a key name of Cost Center might have values that
		// consist of the number associated with the different cost centers in your
		// company. Typically, many resources have tags with the same key name but
		// with different values.AWS always interprets the tag Value as a single
		// string. If you need to store an array, you can store comma-separated
		// values in the string. However, you must interpret the value in your
		// code.
